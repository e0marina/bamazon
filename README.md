Bamazon is a CLI app that's an Amazon-like storefront. The app takes orders from customers (bamazon.js) and deplete's stock from the store's inventory. The manager-side of the app (bamMgr.js) lets a manager view the products that are for sale, view low inventory, add to inventory and add new products.

I created this app for UCLA bootcamp.

Here's a link to a video of how it works: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yp0DqXsvq5lY0LlCZ0iqpz1uV9do0iUu/view
