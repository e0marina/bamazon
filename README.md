Bamazon is a CLI app that's an Amazon-like storefront. The app takes orders from customers (bamazon.js) and deplete's stock from the store's inventory. The manager-side of the app (bamMgr.js) lets a manager view the products that are for sale, view low inventory, add to inventory and add new products.
